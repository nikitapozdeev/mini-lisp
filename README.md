# Mini-lisp

I studied a little C programming at university many years ago, but at a very basic level, and have already forgotten everything.

I have always wanted to learn and do more low-level things, but at work I am not given this opportunity, so I decided to brush up on my knowledge and write something interesting at the same time.

So I didn't know where to start and decided to google project ideas on the Internet and came across an interesting online book [Build Your Own LISP](https://www.buildyourownlisp.com). I really liked the idea of ​​the author, so I decided to go through all the chapters of his book and write my own "mini-lisp" just for fun and learning.
